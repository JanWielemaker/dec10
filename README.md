# The original DEC10 Prolog library

This repo contains the original DEC10 Prolog  library as it as developed
in Edinburgh in the 80s. This library has  been the basis of the Quintus
library as well as the  libraries  of   many  systems  in  the Edinburgh
tradition.

The value of this repository is mainly historical.


## Legal

To the best of my knowledge  this   library  has been released as public
domain software, although the files do not explicitly state such. If you
have more precise information such as a  pointer that either confirms or
denies this claim, please share it.
